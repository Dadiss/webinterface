"XBMC is a Media-Center for videos, Music and more.<br /><br /><sup>#1</"
"sup>Autostart XBMC: if activted, the device boots directly into XBMC. This "
"option is suggested if you use the Player mostly for videos. If the device "
"is not connected to a TV or the video playback is seldom used remove the "
"XBMC from autostart. Therefore it uses less resources.<br /><br /"
"><b>IMPORTANT:</b><br />If XBMC is running Squeezelite will be deactivated! "
"This is neccessary to get Audio in XBMC working. XBMC uses pulseaudio and "
"Squeezelite as well as Shairplay use Alsa to play sounds/music at the same "
